# Stammy
A smooth, organized, powerful hack.chat bot, based on @WebFreak001's API wrapper.
This bot runs on hack.chat/?programming whenever I am online, since I do not have the money or sources to rent a server. It runs on my own PC whenever I open it, and it's hella slow.

# Installation
The bot was coded on 7.5.0, and it will probably run on other versions as well.
As far as the OS is concerned, it was created on Windows 8.1 and then transferred to my new Windows 10 PC. It probably runs perfectly on Linux and OSX, but I don't really know the Bash commands, since I've always been a Windows fanboy.

Plus, I don't have Github Desktop, so here's how to install the bot using the web version.
Go to Stammy's repo on Github, download it as zip and decompress the file in a folder, preferably %userprofile%\Downloads, which is where I host the bot. This path will be used as an example.

```
cd %userprofile%\Downloads
npm install
node main.js
```
It will ask for a channel and nickname, as well as a trip. You can leave the trip blank.
